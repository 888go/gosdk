// CovMetaBlob is a container for holding the meta-data symbol (an
// RODATA variable) for an instrumented Go package. Here "p" points to
// the symbol itself, "len" is the length of the sym in bytes, and
// "hash" is an md5sum for the sym computed by the compiler. When
// the init function for a coverage-instrumented package executes, it
// will make a call into the runtime which will create a covMetaBlob
// object for the package and chain it onto a global list.
